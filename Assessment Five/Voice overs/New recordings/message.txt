Roles  We have assigned roles to each person from the start of week three, we found that if we where to go about this project with no kind of structure then things could get really out of order and that can be catastrophic for a team.  
 
Doug Barrett - Team Leader Doug is the project lead for META Solutions, he ensures the team is on task and on track to                   produce the best results. Doug has taken the team leader role as his dedication to perfection                comes first before anything else, he has had many years experience with running a business               and dealing with not just staff but customers as well, this role has just been a natural fit. Doug                   has also taken on the roles of setting out the projects scope and limits, producing a detailed job                  description for several jobs that will be taken on by another employer once this team's allocated                time has passed. 
 
Matt Wilson - Lead Project Designer and Manager Matt is a committed web designer and front end developer. His work facilitates customer              interaction and provides a platform for the solutions and products at META Solutions. Originally              this project was Matt's idea and dream, so he has come onto this with the title of lead project                   designer, but he is more than that, he takes every aspect of this and refines it so that it is more                     then perfect. 
 
John Rehill - Backend Development John is the backend developer here at META Solutions providing our projects with custom              software tailored to our customers needs. John has also handled working out the groups              timeline and what risks are involved with this project. His dedication to getting things done has                been more than enough and with John's experience with server administration from his last job,               has made this role perfect for him. 
 
Kyle Hudson - Administration Kyle Hudson has taken on the role of becoming the teams administration and HR department.               He has taken the time to gather the group's reflection on what has been going on throughout the                  whole process, made sure that everyone knows their roles and what they are doing in the team.                 He has been a major help for the team leader in gathering ideas for helping the team get                  through any hardships they may encounter. Kyle has fallen into this role nicely as he has                compassion and a way of working with people.
