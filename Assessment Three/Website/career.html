				What common elements are there, if any?  And What differentiates each position from the others?
			</h2>
			<p>
				There are a few common elements when it comes to everyone's ideal jobs, the major on involves a solid grounding in programming and how computers can be connected together to communicate via a range of different protocols. With Matt, Sean and Johns ideal jobs programing will be a core requirement for any job in that field, the languages they need to learn could be vastly different depending on what company they apply for and the jobs that they take on
			
			A quick comparison of two qualifications that are the same skill but different technologies in different jobs could look like this.<br />
			If John was looking for work at Microsoft as a Software Engineer they will be looking for someone who has
			<ul>
				<li>Familiarity with Microsoft .NET technologies (C# and the .NET Framework) and/or competitive offerings (e.g. J2EE, WebLogic or WebSphere). Candidates should have previous experience with multiple product release cycles</li>
				<li>Experience with ASP.NET, MVC, or WCF/Web API or JAX-JS API</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Then if Matt and Sean where looking at Apple for a software engineering job they would be looking for someone who has
				<ul>
					<li>Experience deploying software on elastic platforms such as Kubernetes, EC2, Mesos</li>
					<li>Strong development skills in an OO language. We use Java.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Doug and Kyle where going for more network and communication style jobs, where programming will still be a fundamental skill to have but used in a completely different way, like writing scripts in Bash to run applications automatically, or reading the code of a virus or worm written in C++ or Java that is infecting the company's computers to get an understanding of how to stop it and protect from future ones like it, so yes they all have the same requirements of being able to program but that varies greatly depending on the job and field that person is working in.</p>
			<h2>
				How similar or different are your career plans across the group?
			</h2>
			<p>If you look at the groups desired careers just by their job title, then it looks like we all want similar outcomes, but when you ask each person individually where they want to go with that desired role, that is where it all begins to be vastly different from each other. Some of us just want to gain employment and have a steady job in a field that they are passionate about, but then some of us want to get more than that, we want to fully immerse ourselves in that field, learn everything that we can possibly can learn about it, then move on to something else. So our career plans might look similar but really underneath all the job titles it is enormously different.</p>
