			<h2>
				How we worked in Assessment two?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Assessment two we work extremely well together, at first we had a few issues with team members and people dropping out and no contact, but with these people leaving, we were given a new team member that really fit in.
			</p>
			<h2>
				Things we might change this Assessment?
			</h2>
			<p>
				There will be changes to the team meeting schedule, assessment two we got by with a couple of group meetings with all of us, then kept everyone up to speed with a group chat channel where we could talk to anyone anytime, with this assessment because there are two that need to be worked on, we will be having a lot more meetings as a group, this way we can all be kept up to speed with what's going on.
